## Basics

### Variables and operators

Firstly we write the "hello world" program of JS programming. It's a simple console.log("Hello World!"). This will be used in debugging our application and so on. JS files have the extension ".js" To add external JS files, we do \<script src = "path_to_file.js"\>\<\/script\>.

Variables are declared using the "let" keyword. To declare variables whose values can't be changed after initializing we use the "const" keyword \(which stands for "constant"\) i.e. const variable values can't be re-assigned. "var" keyword can also be used but it's no longer used as part of coding habits. "alert" keyword is used to create pop-ups with the alert msg. Technically we can assign values to variables without defining them \(i.e. without using thte let keyword\), but this is a bad praactice and to avoid this happening we need to put this on our script - "use strict"; .
