## Basics

### Variables and operators

Firstly we write the "hello world" program of JS programming. It's a simple console.log("Hello World!"). This will be used in debugging our application and so on. JS files have the extension ".js" To add external JS files, we do \<script src = "path_to_file.js"\>\<\/script\>.

Variables are declared using the "let" keyword. To declare variables whose values can't be changed after initializing we use the "const" keyword i.e. const variable values can't be re-assigned. "var" keyword can also be used but it's no longer used as part of coding habits.
