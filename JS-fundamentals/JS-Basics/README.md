## Basics

### Variables and operators

Firstly we write the "hello world" program of JS programming. It's a simple console.log("Hello World!"). This will be used in debugging our application and so on. JS files have the extension ".js" To add external JS files, we do \<script src = "path_to_file.js"\>\<\/script\>.

Variables are declared using the "let" keyword. To declare variables whose values can't be changed after initializing we use the "const" keyword \(which stands for "constant"\) i.e. const variable values can't be re-assigned. "var" keyword can also be used but it's no longer used as part of coding habits. "alert" keyword is used to create pop-ups with the alert msg. Technically we can assign values to variables without defining them \(i.e. without using thte let keyword\), but this is a bad praactice and to avoid this happening we need to put this on our script - "use strict"; . In JS numbers are always 64 bit floating point. "NaN" is a JS reserved word pointing to a number that's not legal i.e. Not a Number. "Infinity" or "-Infinity" is a keyword pointing to a number thats outside the largest possible number. Numbers are usually defined as primitiv values from literals, but they can also be defined as objects with "new" keyword. Comparing two JS objects will always return false. JS numbers are of the type "Number". There's another type called "BigInt" also but these are for very very large numbers and not used very often. A string holding a number value can be converted to a number value using the Number() constructor \(this might happen when we get form input as string\). There's also unary plus operator which acts like the Number() constructor i.e. +a and Number(a) do the same thing.
